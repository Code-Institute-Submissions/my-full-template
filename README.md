Yellow Door Coffee
Yellow Door Coffee is a website for a speciality coffee shop in Limerick. The coffee shop is unique because it offers its customers a choice of four different blends of coffee from around the world. Yellow Door Coffee recognizes that individuals have unique tastes; we cater for these tastes by offering a range of flavor notes in our coffee. We actively encourage customers to explore the wide variety of different blends we have on offer, and the minimalist design of our shops uses splashes of yellow to brighten our customer’s day; this style and colour theme has also been incorporated into the website. 
UX
The website was designed with customers and potential customers in mind. The website required clear navigation and ease of use; it needed to be informative and also visually engaging. The images used through-out the site are in-keeping with the style of the cafe and have been selected to give users some sense of the Yellow Door Coffee experience.

Technologies Used
The following languages, frameworks and libraries were used throughout the design of this website to accomodate the design, structre and style:
•	JQuery - The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
•	HTML – the project uses html as the main language to build the website
•	Bootstrap – The bootstrap frame work is used to style and layout the website
•	CSS – CSS is used to add individual style to the website
•	Pixlr – Pixlr was used to resize images for use on the website
•	Font Awesome – this site was used to add icons to the site.
•	Canva – to make images

Testing
In order to assure that the webiste performs efficiently and the features carry out the functions that they are created to, I conducted several tests which are outlined below.
•	I investigated the responsiveness of the website by utilizing the Google Chrome extension to establish that the site was receptive to all device sizes; mobiles, tablets and monitors. For certain sections such as the Our Coffee page, padding and margins were removed using media queries to allow the page be viewed from effectively on smaller devices. 

•	I tested all the navigation links repeatedly to guarantee that they worked from each individual page.


•	I loaded pages several times to verify that the images loaded perfectly every time, as well as establishing that images appeared zoomed if they were designed to do so. 

•	I confirmed that all buttons on the site performed the task that they were set out to, E.G; the find out more button on the homepage brings the user to the About Us page. 


•	For the Contact form, I tested it’s function by: 
i.	Go to the “Contact Us” page
ii.	 Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
                         iii.       Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Deployment
I used GitPod to develop my project, this is where I wrote my code and ran it to assure it performed. On completion of each section I committed the work to GitHub. From the Github platform, I deployed the project to a hosting platform.  The project is hosted on Github Pages; in order to make the project go live, I had to insure I had the correct settings employed in Github. There is a Github Pages section in the repository settings which needed to be activated. Once activated it advised me that my site was available at the following address: https://jadeosull93.github.io/my-full-template/ - it is critical to note that the homepage needs to be identified as index.html for Gitpages to find it and publish the site. 

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).
In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
•	Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
•	Different configuration files?
•	Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
